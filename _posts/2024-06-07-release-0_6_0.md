The Kroxylicious project is very pleased to announce the release of [Kroxylicious 0.6.0](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/releases/tag/v0.6.0). See the [Changelog](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#060) for a list of changes and summary of Deprecations, Changes and Removals.

### AWS KMS integraion for Record Encryption

This release add integration with [AWS's Key Management System](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/overview.html) into Kroxylicious Record Encryption. With this, you'll be able to [choose AWS KMS](https://kroxylicious.io/docs/v0.6.0/#aws-key-management-service) for storage of the key material used to keep your records safe.

### SASL OAuth Token Validation Filter

This release adds the [SASL OAuth Token Validation Filter](https://kroxylicious.io/docs/v0.6.0/#oauthbearer-validation) to the growing list of Kroxylicious Filters.  Use this filter to help protect your Kafka Cluster from the excessive load generated when client applications continually present an invalid/expired OAuth token.

### Improved support for Kafka Clusters using Discontinuous Node-ids

This release includes a [_range aware port-per-broker networking scheme_](https://kroxylicious.io/docs/v0.6.0/#rangeawareportpernode-scheme) that allows Kroxylicious to better support Kafka Clusters using discontinuous node-ids or node-id ranges that start at values other than 0.
