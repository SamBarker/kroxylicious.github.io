The Kroxylicious team has been out on the conference circuit this year talking about our efforts around Record Encryption:
- Tom was presenting at [Kafka Summit London](https://www.confluent.io/events/kafka-summit-london-2024/safeguarding-your-kafka-data-with-encryption-at-rest/)
- Keith was presenting at [UK Systems Research Challenges Workshop](https://uksystems.org/workshop/2024/) - [Slides](/assets/uksystems2024.pdf)
- Sam was presenting at [Kafka Summit Bangalore](https://www.confluent.io/events/kafka-summit-bangalore-2024/hiding-your-data-from-prying-eyes/) - [Slides](/assets/20240424-KSB24-Red_Hat_Barker_Sam.pdf)

All the sessions were well received by their on site audiences, and we hope you find the recordings just as interesting! 

Recordings from the Kafka Summit sessions (including the Question and Answer sections) are now available, one does need to give Confluent an email address for access but they are otherwise freely available.
